# School District Analysis

### Project Overview
To analyze data on student funding and standardized test scores, where the analysis will assist the schoolboard in determining school budget. The primary task is to aggregate data and showcase trends in school performance. 

### Resources
- Data Source: students_complete.csv
               schools_complete.csv
- Software: Python 3.6.9, Jupyter Notebook, Pandas Library

### Objectives
- Create a school district level summary with a high-level snapshot of the district's key metrics, such as the total number of students, total number of schools, total budget, average math and reading scores, percentage of students who passed math and reading, and the overall passing percentage.  
- Create a summary for each school with the aforementioned key metrics.
- Additional requiremetns:
  - Sort schools into Top and Bottom 5
  - Group scores by grade
  - Group scores by school spending per student
  - Group scores by school size
  - Group scores by school type

### Summary
The analysis of the School District Summary, School Summary, and additional requirements can be seen at PyCitySchool.ipynb. Attached is a link to the results.

### Challenge
It was noticed that the math and reading scores for the 9th grade class at Thomas High School were incorrect, so their scores were removed from the analysis without removing the students themselves.

### Challenge Objectives
- Filter DataFrames using logical operators.
- Replace incorrect values with NaN.
- Explain how your PyCitySchoools analysis changes after you handle the incorrect data. 

### Summary
The analysis of the School District Summary, School Summary, and additional requirements can be seen at PyCitySchools_Challenge.ipynb. Attached is a link to the results, and a written report of how the analysis changed after replacing the scores of the 9th grade class at Thomas High School.
